### Hi there, stranger! 👽

My name is Sasha... and that's all I've got, really.

Some boring things about me:

- 📛 Even though my full name is Alexander, I'd much prefer if you call me Sasha.
- ☕ My timezone is [CET](https://time.is/CET), but I'm often available at other times as well.
- 🌐 You know, I'm something of a [translator to Russian](https://crowdin.com/profile/brawaru) myself. I'm currently learning German :)
- 🧊 Love Minecraft and experimenting with plugins and mods. The stuff I find good [is open-source](https://github.com/Brawaru?tab=repositories&language=java).
- 🧠 I know technical terms too!! See. Uhhh.. JS/TS, Node.js, Java, Go, Rust, what [is in fact, GNU/Linux](https://devrant.com/rants/1051771/).
- 👨🏻‍💻 Pronouns are [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) or [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves). Whichever you prefer.
- 🐘 I shitpost a lot on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@sasha_sorokin) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@brawaru). Follow for ‘WHO ASKED?!’ opinions.
- 🍵 While I cannot access donations directly, you can instead [support my friends](https://www.gofundme.com/f/g3rrms-help-with-medical-bills), that means a lot.
- ⏱ I track my code activity [with WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@Brawaru).
- 🖼 This lovely profile picture of mine is created using [icon maker](https://picrew.me/image_maker/148413) by [@buffalobellie](https://twitter.com/buffalobellie)!

Anyway, nice to meet ya.
