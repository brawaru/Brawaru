# Support Brawaru

Hi! I'm Brawaru, an open-source developer, moderator, and just a friend to some
of you.

For the longest time I've been actively contributing to a lot of different
projects that I like and offered my help to the people I care about.

Here are some of the highlights:

- [Translations and other contributions to Mastodon][contrib_mastodon]
- [Moderation and contributions to Modrinth][contrib_modrinth]
- [VIntl library for Vue and Nuxt][contrib_vintl]

[contrib_vintl]: https://github.com/vintl-dev
[contrib_mastodon]:
  https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3Abrawaru
[contrib_modrinth]:
  https://github.com/brawaru?org=modrinth#js-contribution-activity

Unfortunately, I didn't succeeded at life as a person and those contributions
are the least I can do to feel like a contributing member of society. However,
everything I do, I do it for free. I don't have a real job and don't see having
one right now due to _reasons_.

Sadly, times are getting really hard and now I cannot even afford the essentials
like food, clothing, or rent. So I sincerely ask you, if I have helped you
or your project, or you just like my work, please consider supporting me
financially, it would really mean a lot these days. Don't do that if you are in
difficult situation yourself.

## Donation methods

Due to _circumstances_ I cannot have GitHub Sponsors and have to rely on
less-popular platforms. Depending on your location, you can make monthly or
single donations through [Boosty][boosty] worldwide. You can also donate using
[Yoomoney][yoomoney] in Russia.

> **Note**
>
> With Boosty, you can subscribe monthly or make a one-off donation. You need an
> account, but you can also sign up using third party services like Google or
> Twitch. Boosty's billing is done through its parent company, ‘CEBC B.V’, and
> will be listed like that in your card transactions, don't get confused!

> **Warning**
>
> If you are in Russia, please use Yoomoney instead, as Boosty's fees are
> draconian (~10%, not including withdrawal and exchange fees). Yoomoney only
> charges around 3%.

## Cryptocurrencies

I don't like cryptocurrencies, but it's one of the ways to send me money. Please
[use my form][crypto] to request my actual wallet addresses.

## Legal stuff

Payments made through either of the platforms are considered donations and, as such, do not provide any benefits or bonuses. Donations do not influence my moderation actions and cannot be used to evade or appeal moderation actions in any of the communities I moderate. Donations also do not grant priority to support tickets, issues, feature requests, or pull/merge/review requests created by a donor. However, they do allow me to allocate more time to address these requests and resolve those from donors in the process.

By making a donation through either of the platforms, you confirm that you are doing so voluntarily as a gift and not as a direct payment for the work I have done or may do for you.
