# Support Brawaru

If I have helped you or your project, or you just like my work, please
consider supporting me financially (if you can, of course), it would really
help these days. Depending on your location, you can do it through
[Boosty][boosty] (worldwide) or [Yoomoney][yoomoney] (in Russia).

> **Note**
> 
> With Boosty, you can subscribe monthly or make a one-off donation to the 
> ‘Goal’. You need an account, but you can also sign up using third party
> services like Google or Twitch. Unfortunately, they use Russian roubles
> (₽) for subscriptions, so you'll need to [convert][conv] and check with
> your bank for exchange fees. Please note that all of Boosty's billing is
> done through its parent company, ‘MY.GAMES BV’.

> **Warning**
>
> If you are in Russia, please use Yoomoney instead, as Boosty's fees are
> draconian (~10%, not including withdrawal and exchange fees). Yoomoney only
> charges around 3%.
