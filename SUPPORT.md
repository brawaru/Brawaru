# Support Brawaru

If I helped you or your project, or you just appreciate my work, please
consider supporting me financially (if you can, of course), it would really
help these days. Depending on your location, you can do it through
[Boosty][boosty] (worldwide) or [Yoomoney][yoomoney] (in Russia).

> **Note**
>
> With Boosty you can subscribe monthly or donate only one time towards the
> ‘Goal’. You will need an account, but they provide ability to sign up using
> third-party services like Google or Twitch. Unfortunately they use Russian
> Rouble (₽), so you need to [convert it][conv] and check with your bank for
> exchange fees.

> **Warning**
>
> If you are in Russia, please use Yoomoney instead, because Boosty fees are
> draconian (~10%, not accounting for withdrawal and exchange fees). Yoomoney
> only take about 3%.
